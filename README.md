## Details

### Overview
SMPTE ST 2138-10 _Catena — Model_ specifies a standardization of communication methods between (micro)services and full products designed for hybrid cloud and on-premises solutions, with the goal of making it easy to secure, connect and control a multi-vendor ecosystem of media processing services and microservices, no matter where they are in a true plug-and-play model.

### The Hybrid Environment Reality
Today's environments typically encompass a combination of on-premises and cloud environments. Solutions span a variety of platforms, and must interoperate, regardless of where they are hosted.

### The Need for More Seamless Multi-Vendor Integration
The number of devices, products, and services from a wide array of vendors can be daunting, particularly with the move to microservices. Media companies need technologies to simply work together.

### Security Emerging as a Priority
The need to secure environments and the connections between products and services in a standardized manner is a must. ST 2138-10 prioritizes the security of the transport between each device.
